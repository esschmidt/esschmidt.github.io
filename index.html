        <p>I'm Emily (she/her), an MSLIS student at the Pratt Institute School of Information, graduating in May 2021. As a fellow at The Metropolitan Museum of Art's <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/libraries-and-research-centers/thomas-j-watson-library">Thomas J. Watson Library</a>, I'm supporting digital collections and systems projects that highlight and improve access to the library's resources. I also work in a public-facing role in the Access Services department of the <a href="https://library.baruch.cuny.edu/">Newman Library</a> at Baruch College, CUNY.</p>
        <p>Before moving into librarianship, I spent eight years working at non-profit organizations focused on architecture, design, and the built environment. As a program manager at The Architectural League of New York, I organized numerous events (including a yearlong <a href="https://archleague.org/project/housing-brass-tacks/">discussion series</a> and a daylong <a href="https://archleague.org/project/tower-slab-superblock-social-housing-legacies-futures/">conference</a>) and wrote and edited articles on issues at the intersection of design, policy, and politics in housing. Previously, as a project manager at the community design center bcWORKSHOP, I worked on <a href="https://www.bcworkshop.org/neighborhood-stories">community storytelling</a>, <a href="https://www.bcworkshop.org/posts/dallas-neighborhood-map">neighborhood</a> <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2012/09/05/the-definition-of-your-dallas-neighborhood-is-about-to-get-very-specific/">mapping</a>, and <a href="https://www.bcworkshop.org/bcanalytics-catalog/">data analysis</a> projects.</p>
        <p>I'm originally from Chicago and I hold a B.A. in American studies from Wesleyan University.</p>
