        <p>I'm Emily (she/her), a new graduate of the MSLIS program at the Pratt Institute School of Information. I currently work in the Access Services department of the <a href="https://library.baruch.cuny.edu/">Newman Library</a> at Baruch College, CUNY, and was recently a fellow at The Metropolitan Museum of Art's <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/libraries-and-research-centers/thomas-j-watson-library">Watson Library</a>, where I supported digital collections and systems projects that highlight and improve access to the library's resources.</p>
        <p>Before moving into librarianship, I spent eight years at architecture and design non-profit organizations. As a program manager at The Architectural League of New York, I organized numerous events (including a yearlong <a href="https://archleague.org/project/housing-brass-tacks/">discussion series</a> and a daylong <a href="https://archleague.org/project/tower-slab-superblock-social-housing-legacies-futures/">conference</a>) and wrote and edited articles on issues of design, policy, and politics in housing. Previously, as a project manager at the community design center bcWORKSHOP, I worked on <a href="https://www.bcworkshop.org/neighborhood-stories">community storytelling</a>, <a href="https://www.bcworkshop.org/posts/dallas-neighborhood-map">neighborhood</a> <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2012/09/05/the-definition-of-your-dallas-neighborhood-is-about-to-get-very-specific/">mapping</a>, and <a href="https://www.bcworkshop.org/bcanalytics-catalog/">data analysis</a> projects.</p>
        <p>I'm originally from Chicago and I hold a BA in American studies from Wesleyan University.</p>
