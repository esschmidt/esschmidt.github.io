        <p>I'm an MLIS student at the Pratt Institute School of Information (expected graduation May 2021) with particular interests in reference and outreach, information-seeking behavior and needs, and technical services. I am currently a fellow at The Met's <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/libraries-and-research-centers/thomas-j-watson-library">Thomas J. Watson Library</a> focused on digital collections and systems projects. I also work in the Access Services department of the <a href="https://library.baruch.cuny.edu/">Newman Library</a> at Baruch College, CUNY. My volunteer experience includes two years as a citizenship exam prep coach at a public library and in sales and inventory at a non-profit bookstore.</p>
        <p>Before moving into librarianship, I spent eight years working at non-profit organizations focused on architecture, design, and the built environment. As a program manager focused on housing issues at <a href="https://archleague.org">The Architectural League of New York</a>, I organized numerous events (including a yearlong <a href="https://archleague.org/project/housing-brass-tacks/">discussion series</a> and a daylong <a href="https://archleague.org/project/tower-slab-superblock-social-housing-legacies-futures/">conference</a>) on pressing issues at the intersection of design, policy, and politics in housing. I also regularly wrote, commissioned articles, conducted interviews, and edited for the organization's website and its magazine, <a href="https://urbanomnibus.net/">Urban Omnibus</a>. Previously, as a project manager at the community design center <a href="https://bcworkshop.org">bcWORKSHOP</a>, I worked on <a href="https://www.bcworkshop.org/neighborhood-stories">community storytelling</a>, <a href="https://www.bcworkshop.org/posts/dallas-neighborhood-map">neighborhood</a> <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2012/09/05/the-definition-of-your-dallas-neighborhood-is-about-to-get-very-specific/">mapping</a>, and <a href="https://www.bcworkshop.org/bcanalytics-catalog/">data analysis</a>. I hold a B.A. in American studies, with a concentration in urban studies, from Wesleyan University.</p>
