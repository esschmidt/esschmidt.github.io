        <p>I'm Emily (she/her), the Journalism and Government Information Librarian at the Columbia University Libraries. There I collaborate with students and faculty in the School of Journalism on research support, collection development, and instruction, and with students and faculty from across the university on government documents research. I previously worked as a librarian at the New York School of Interior Design, as a fellow at The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Thomas J. Watson Library, and as a library assistant at Baruch College's Newman Library. Some information topics on my mind are critical information and visual literacy, effective instruction services, and digital accessibility.</p>
        <p>Before moving into librarianship, I spent eight years working at non-profit organizations focused on architecture, design, and the built environment. As a project manager at The Architectural League of New York, I organized numerous <a href="https://archleague.org/project/housing-brass-tacks/">programs</a> and <a href="https://archleague.org/project/tower-slab-superblock-social-housing-legacies-futures/">events</a> as well as <a href="https://urbanomnibus.net/author/emily/">wrote</a> and edited articles on issues at the intersection of design, policy, and politics in housing. Previously, as a project manager at the community design center bcWORKSHOP, I worked on <a href="https://www.bcworkshop.org/neighborhood-stories">community storytelling</a>, <a href="https://www.bcworkshop.org/posts/dallas-neighborhood-map">neighborhood</a> <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2012/09/05/the-definition-of-your-dallas-neighborhood-is-about-to-get-very-specific/">mapping</a>, and <a href="https://www.bcworkshop.org/bcanalytics-catalog/">data analysis</a> projects.</p>
        <p>I hold an MSLIS from the Pratt Institute School of Information and a BA in American studies from Wesleyan University. I'm originally from Chicago.</p>
